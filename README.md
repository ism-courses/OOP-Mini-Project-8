Suppose your have a Vehicle class defined in this repository.

The boss wants you to create additional class using inheritance. Here are the steps:
1. Define a **Car** class that inherits from the **Vehicle** class.
2. Add unique instance attributes, **num_doors**, **is_electric**, to the **Car** class
3. Create an instance of **Car** and assign it to an object variable **my_car**. You can choose any values (that make sense in this context) as the arguments.
4. Print all attributes of **my_car**.
